70,If Kooch is hurt we are so cooked holy shit,12
71,Koochie can take a pounding and just bounce right back.,12
72,Whatever they gave Svech during his recovery they need to put the whole team on for a couple days. He‚Äôs playing like a mad man tonight,12
73,Has Andersen been watching from the box or has been at home playing baldurs gate?,12
74,That might‚Äôve been our best period of the season. Do it again in the third.,12

77,I boinked between the period cause I was fired up. This night just keeps getting better.,13
78,"I met Brady Skjei at a restaurant once - we‚Äôd accidentally been given his table. Apparently he was fond of the restaurant and had a specific table he liked, and the management had messed up and gotten their days wrong, (it was Tuesday and they thought he was coming on Thursday or something like that).

Anyway, the manager, completely embarrassed (this is a pretty nice restaurant) comes by and says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, but we‚Äôd like to move you to another table if you could be troubled, and we‚Äôll gladly compensate you for the cost of the meal and any other meal you‚Äôd like while you‚Äôre in town.‚Äù My sister and cousin were both like ‚ÄúYeah that‚Äôs cool.‚Äù and I kind of played the asshole a bit.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I just don‚Äôt understand. We‚Äôve been here for 15 minutes - we‚Äôve just ordered. Can‚Äôt we finish our meal here?‚Äù

Then out of nowhere Brady hows up next to the manager and leads us in a riveting prayer circle.

And I (being a big Skjeisy fan) said ‚ÄúOh wow, uh‚Ä¶ I had no idea. Please feel free to give them the table.‚Äù

Brady was grateful, shook my hand and said thanks, then gave me a card with his number on it and told me to give him a call later. After working up the nerve, I gave him a call that night, and to make a long story short, we had a glorious 11 month love affair, man on man, that I shall never forget. Our bodies intertwined as one, and from the beauty of Morocco, to the French Riviera, to the snorkeling in the Galopagos, Brady Skjei and I made glorious gay love to each other on six of the seven continents.",12

106,Canes will build confidence over then next few games and become absolutely dominant. Kooch will completely lock in and it will be ‚ÄúFreddie who?‚Äù  Svech will score 25 more. IMO.,12
107," typically, a team should pull their goalie with around 3 minutes left. Considering that we are up by five, we should multiply that three by five, which means they should pull their goalie with 15 minutes left.

Canes Last Game: 2-1 Loss (SO) to the Washington Capitals on Sunday, December 17

-

Golden Knights Record: 21-6-5 (44 Points, 1st, Pacific Division)

Golden Knights Last Game: 6-3 Win over the Ottawa Senators on Sunday, December 17


Last Time Out

Pyotr Kochetkov put together another stellar outing on Sunday, allowing just one goal for a third consecutive game. Unfortunately for Carolina, their offense was only able to give him one goal of support. Boiling down to a shootout, Evgeny Kuznetsov secured the win for Washington. Rod Brind'Amour and the players said that they felt good about the performance, but a power play goal instead of going 0-for-5 on the evening could have made all the difference.


Working From Home

Sebastian Aho was the lone goal-scorer for Carolina on Sunday, his second consecutive game with a marker.  Aho has now also scored a goal in each of his last four games at PNC Arena, marking the longest home goal streak by any Canes skater over the last two seasons.  He leads the team with 15 points (6g, 9a) at PNC Arena this season, and his six goals have tied Teuvo Teravainen for the team lead on home ice. Aho has earned 260 points (113g, 147a) in 271 career regular-season games at PNC Arena, with the second-most points and third-most goals in this building of any Hurricanes skater. 


Svechnikov Back Already?

On December 4 in Winnipeg, Andrei Svechnikov took a cross-check to the midsection from Jets defenseman Logan Stanley. After playing through the pain in the team's next game, an MRI later in the week revealed that the winger would be ""out for a while."" Just three days ago Brind'Amour said he was ""not close"" to playing, but after being a full participant in Monday's practice, including power play time, it appears a swift turn of events could have him back in the lineup as soon as tonight.


In Net

With Antti Raanta having been reassigned to the Chicago Wolves on Sunday, Kochetkov and first-year pro Yaniv Perets are tasked with defending the net for Carolina for the foreseeable future. Given that Perets came straight from the ECHL, it is presumed that Kochetkov will assume #1 duties and play as often as the schedule allows him. Allowing three total goals in his last three games, it feels like a foregone conclusion that he'll be in the crease again this evening.


On The Other Side

There has been no Stanley Cup hangover in Sin City this season, as the Golden Knights come to town leading the NHL in points.  They can score, producing 109 goals already this season (3rd in the NHL).  They can defend, allowing just 80 goals (10th in the NHL).  Their power play and penalty kill are also both among the top 10 in the league.  There aren't many areas where they don't excel, but if there's one element to try and take advantage of, Vegas ranks 21st with a 49.4% win percentage in the faceoff circle.


Injury Updates

Goaltender Frederik Andersen has been sidelined since the team announced on November 6 that he is dealing with a blood clotting issue.  General Manager Don Waddell shared on December 17 that he has been cleared and could start skating again soon.

Forward Andrei Svechnikov suffered an upper-body injury on December 4 but has been skating with the team at practice this week.  He is a game-time decision for this evening's contest.

3,"I love that we're winning but if we're gonna be a playoff team we gotta score more. I dont think we have the firepower yet to be a real threat, we're winning games by being relentless and not with skill. Its possible we manage to finish the season with home ice for the first round and Ill be fuckin pumped the whole time even if we lose. But we have a real chance to leverage some of the value that Torts and Danny have built, names like Walker Seeler and Risto have all been in rumors and regardless where we are in the standings we should be selling some assets to try to acquire some picks and maybe prospects that have tangible upsides. Its good that this group has played this well, and theres no reason to think losing Walker or Seeler will tank the season but if it does then we were never ready to compete this year. I can understand not making moves if we're comfortably in second place at the deadline because the playoff experience will be good for everyone and we'll see who finds the next gear, but if we're fighting to be a wildcard we need to sell. This is the second game against the Preds in a week or so, hopefully the team learned enough the first game and has a gameplan to solve their goalies, we need some convincing wins before Im convinced.",12

Haven't watched every game this year, only a few periods here and there but they are fun to watch man.

46,I assume they‚Äôre wearing white. Is it still the white on white numbers with red outline,1
47,Yes we lost the previous game to them 2-5 despite outshooting them 40-15. Hart got yanked early and Sam wasn't much better,2
48,I remember the last few seasons I watched the PP was painfully inconsistent. They‚Äôd have stretches where they‚Äôd be completely unable to possess the puck in the offensive zone and would go like 1-20 on the PP over weeks before heating up. It was the consistency that drove me crazy.,1

105,Boosh just said 2 minutes. But he's bleeding. Wouldn't that make it an automatic 4 minutes. Also Frost went to the locker room. Doesn't that add time to a call?,4

108,Good bye bye asshole,3

Union Station itself is worth entering if you‚Äôre coming off the rail. Maybe for half an hour. It was part of the revitalization project ‚Äúled‚Äù be Dana Crawford.

I slink around Broadway where I used to work, but it is a bit of an extra walk. 16th Street Mall is being updated and won‚Äôt be complete until 2025; when I was there in September the center was torn up and partitioned off.",7
1,Cooper lounge in union station is a great setting for a fancy holiday cocktail. We also love Death and Co. (a little farther from walking distance). There‚Äôs also a ton of little places in lohi that are cool/kind of close.,3
2,Where are you staying?,3
3,German Christmas market is fun and nearby.,4
4,"Along with other things mentioned, the Denver Christkindlmarket near the capital is awesome to go to. A quick uber or scooter over to Rino for food, bevs and looking at artwork is cool too.",2
5,"Check out the Denver city pass. It gives you like 5-7 events to choose from and discounts for bundling. I have used it a couple of times, and I'm a native! Lol",3
6,If you want to see the mountains take the flatiron flyer bus to Boulder and then either walk or get a Lyft to Chataqua Park. Lots of gorgeous walks and hikes.,2
7,Zoo lights or the botanical gardens are awesome if you can get tickets.,1
8,"Check out RiNo (River North) and LoHi (Lower Highlands) for drinks and food! Both have lots of options and are very walkable. Riverfront area is a nice open green space near by as well.

If you are open to going a bit further out, the Tennyson/41st area is a gem IMHO.

The LoDo (Lower Downtown) and Cap Hill areas are more traditional party/night out areas with a younger crowd, can get a bit sketchy though.

The Christmas market, Botanic Gardens ""Blossoms of Light"", and Daniels & Fisher tower are all festive rn and fun to check out.

Lots of good museums for varying subjects in town. Nature & Science, Art, Aerospace, and Transportation are highlights.

Feel free to DM me if you want any specific restaurant recs!",1
9,"Night of game have a burger at Chop House and uber/walk/barhop to stadium.  You avoid the crowds of Brooklyns (which really stinks frankly), get to see Coors Field and hang at the spot Sackic, Roy and Foresberg hung their hat back in the day.  (Burger because it is a high end steakhouse (casual though)).",1
10,"You can get to some pretty sweet places by rail.  I assume you'll be taking the train from DIA so you've seen quite a bit but I'd recommend taking the Gold line to Arvada and get off at the Arvada Station.  The downtown there is mostly blocked off for walking and is at the rail stop.  Tons to explore there, get a good dinner or lunch and maybe some ice cream then head back to Union Station for a night cap at the terminal bar or go upstairs to the bar others have recommended.  

Just off 10th and Osage station is the oldest restaurant in Denver serving game like Elk and Rocky Mountain Oysters.  

If you didn't come in on the DIA train take the A line to 61st and Pena and either hop the free shuttle to the Gaylord which has like 5 restaurants.  Or walk/bike/scoot/uber a couple blocks to the Moonlight Diner which is a great diner with a full bar.

There's so many things to do here you really just have to make your own fun.  The RINO options suggested are great too or if the weather is good go all the way west on the G line to the end of the line then Uber to Red Rocks because even a day trip there is an adventure.  

My last suggestion is to just hang in Denver.  I love Citizen Rail for a fantastic steak or Jax for some Oysters.  Domo is right off the rail line as well and I heard they reopened.  The Capital building is accessible via free public transit from Union Station and the Capitol is very pretty and light up this time of year.  Also the Capital tour is free and super worth the time imo.  

Have fun, enjoy the game!  Go ASS and Hail Satan",1

12,"Walking distance to Ball Arena, maybe a block or two.",2
13,"It is an open, walking only street, but it is missing a lot of its former glory with work and a lot of missing tenants.",2
14,"Go to Meow Wolf for sure. The aquarium is fun. Tivoli brewing. If the weather is nice (it is until friday) and you have time, check out the Botanical gardens and the zoo. Those aren't walking distance, but it's a short Uber. Have breakfast at Sam's #3 at least once.",7
0,Remember when the Avs had a lead going into the 3rd against the defending Stanley Cup champs Tampa Bay lightning and played like the most perfect period of shutdown hockey in history? That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm gonna choose to think about right now.,42
1,I should have gone to bed when the Avs did,31
2,Can‚Äôt wait for the next Toews quote,30
3,"The team fell asleep at 4-1 and refused to wake up until the Yotes won.

We don't deserve the point. That was fucking horrific. Credit to the Yotes they were absolutely dominant the whole 3rd.

Wood with 2 breakaways missed and then he allowed for another breakaway the other direction in OT. Fuck me.",29
4,The dreaded 4 goal lead,25
5,"that might have been the worst 3rd period i‚Äôve ever seen out of the boys. 

We must have given up 8-10 prime scoring opportunities to just make 1 extra pass that did nothing at best and turned the puck over at worst. Also‚Ä¶ Manson in overtime is an insanely questionable decision which ultimately led to the gwg. 

Besides all that though, can we please get rid of ryan johansen? he‚Äôs a fucking pylon out there and is literally a $4M waste of space.",21
6,"He‚Äôs not the sole solution, but I miss Landy :(",21
7,That was fucking pathetic,17
8,"Hang your heads boys, that was fucking embarrassing, up 4 fucking zero and you lose that game.",17
9,Bednar needs to learn what a timeout is. You have no excuse not to call one after that 3rd goal.,39
10,Ngl I hope bednar has em do suicides back and forth like in miracle. That was a weak minded loss. Have a 3rd period like that is disgusting. Manson bro what the fuck man.,15
11,"If you guys all agree, I would prefer to never think or speak of this game ever again",13
12,"One glaring stat - Nuke, Rants, MacKinnon all had around 24-25 minutes of ice time.  That's 6 minutes more than the highest forward on the Coyotes and 15 minutes more than the Avs lowest TOI forward (Kiviranta).

As much as these guys are horses it's just not sustainable long term.  Hopefully when Lehky is back the second line can stabilize a little and you can move pieces a bit but man there were times you could tell Mack couldn't even move in OT.",14
13,Don't worry guys. This is wake up call number 10 this season.,32
14,"The end of that OT was painful. That‚Äôs a lot of bad turnovers from guys who we‚Äôve come to expect a lot better from. Not a good look, and doesn‚Äôt bode well going forward since they should have had their wake up call about 5 other times this season",12
15,"It is truly inexplicable how this team can be so good for any 2 given periods of a game and then look like they‚Äôve never seen a puck for the remaining period. 

Awful loss. Worst of the year by far.",23
16,Unbelievably low IQ play by Manson at the end there,25
17,Druin (820k salary) out performs RyJo (4 MIL salary) every night.. HMMMMMM,25
18,"5 unanswered, eh? Super fun. The tale of two teams continues.",9
19,"Our D needs to cover the net so much better. They allowed so many shots that just couldn't reasonably be bailed out by Georgie alone. I won't pretend that Georgie's a god, but this is absolutely not entirely on his shoulders.",10
20,We do an absolutely remarkable job of shooting ourselves in the damn foot. How do we get that disheveled after one goal in? It's like an entire defensive breakdown and shattered confidence in net.,12
21,What the actual fuck was that garbage?,10
22,"Dude. Wtf. Checked the score before dinner, we good... again on the way home... üò≠",10
23,"I think this is the Avs this season. Good wins and ugly losses. Every time they win it's like ‚Äúok we're figuring it out‚Äù and then they do shit like last night. This far into the season it's pretty set in stone that this is who we are, will just be a matter of which team shows up come playoffs.",10
24,I‚Äôm a big Georgiev fan but he‚Äôs been woefully inadequate more often than not this year. And Bednar once again refused to call Timeout when his team was getting bodied. Stupid stubborn Coach.,28
25,"Makar with a blown puck handle behind the net, again. I swear I‚Äôve seen this before. What the shit.",10
26,Fucking embarrassing. Just letting this mediocre team skate circles around our zone like it's nothing.,7
27,"They need to address the defense BADLY. I mean, there are way too many lapses and open chances. 

Sure, Georgie needs to play better too, but at this point it‚Äôs not all on him.",17
28,Wtf,7
29,I‚Äôm not even going to look at the /r/hockey PGT. I‚Äôll probably have to jump off a bridge.,9
30,Just. What the ever loving fuck?,7
31,This team is mentally weak.,15
32,Josh Manson is a turnover merchant,13
33,I liked the part where the Avs had a 4-0 lead and decided to piss it away against the Yotes,7
34,Terrible outcome of not closing again :(,8
35,What the fuck what the fuck what the fuck,9
36,Absolutely brutal. Not sure why this team seems to just go into the tank after taking a lead. Maybe we should just let the opponent score first every night.,6
37,That was my first in person Avs game and it was a total punch in the nuts,7
38,East coast here -- went to bed at 4-1. What the hell,6
39,"I'm sorry but the yotes don't even fucking deserve that win that's the most fucking annoying part of that game to me

that dumb fuck kissing his stick during their celly like he fucking did something holy shit",10
40,this team is extremely good at blowing large leads. one of the best. excellent. you can't take that away from them,12
41,"Georgiev was not great tonight and hasn‚Äôt been great all season. That being said, look at the guys who are supposedly the elite tenders in the league. From most peoples‚Äô consensus top 3, Sorokin, Vasilevskiy, and Shesterkin are 12th, 21st, and 22nd in the league in SV% right now. Bob is 18th. Gibson is 25th. The current top goalies statistically speaking are mostly no names and castoffs. Hellebuyck is really the only supposedly elite goalie in the top 10 and he is 8th. I guess maybe you could argue Demko is close to an elite name, he is 9th.  Adin Hill, who most people probably hadn‚Äôt even heard of before last year is 1st. 30 year old Charlie Lindgren who had started 29 games in 6 seasons before last season is 2nd. Swayman can‚Äôt really say anything bad about him is 3rd. 36 year old Cam Fucking Talbot is 4th! 37 year old Jonathan Quick is 5th. Goalies are so hard to predict, and getting harder by the minute. Not sure who I would even want the Avs to go after at this point.",10
42,I can forgive a lot but getting beat far side on a wraparound is not acceptable.,13
43,Wtf did I see?,5
44,That shit is so pathetic man. We always do that shit against the yotes in mullet,6

47,"Fuck me, I think this was the biggest swing in emotions during a game that I've felt all season. And that's saying something!",4
48,"Never in my god damn life have I seen a play like that one in OT from Josh Manson 

He needs to be benched for that, unacceptable. Guy breaks a stick, you have a chance for a break, and he skated like he was 90 years old and turned it over and blew the game 

Each nachos you fat fuck",20
49,"We always lose to trashcan teams and make them look like super stars. The Avs looked like they couldn't care less in the 3rd, and it got even worse in OT. How many times do you honestly need Georgie to bail you out of atrocious defensive play? Give me a break with this nonsense garbage play.",11
50,"Piss poor defense and goaltending in the third and ot did this team in tonight. Bednar should have called a timeout when the Coyotes came within one goal. Bednar should not have had Manson and Wood out there in OT. Georgiev simply isn't fulfilling his end of the bargain. The third goal was a killer. I don't know if it's mental, or bad positioning, or both, but he keeps letting in bad goals at the worst time.",19
51,"We need to start having a serious talk about Georgiev, I understand we can't rely solely on the goalie and the team has left Georgiev out to dry but he is letting in the softest shit that a starting goalie needs to be stopping",28

Also atleast 3 players on the coyotes deserved a fist to the nose. Where's our physicality. I'm tired of the ""no leadership"" bull shit. Someone needs to step up and fire the guys up.

Oops on LOC lmfao. Will leave it.

Honestly, I liked Sturm too, that was a hell of a team.",13
68,Absolutely zero motivation from 75% of the team. Hope this can be remedied this season yet.,10

70,avs loved to be embarrassed in games this year. 4 goal comeback. blown out by bad teams. B2b shutout. preds 2 goal comeback. lose to blackhawks who are not only trash but were missing players. Getting embarrassed is happening WAY to frequently this year. Something needs to change.,8

Georgiev is fine. Just fine.

That's not going to be good enough.",10
73,Georgie is incredibly inconsistent. He often gives up flurries of goals. Having a less than 50% save percentage in the 3rd is inexcusable but he often gives up goals in a hurry. I don‚Äôt have an answer to the problem but it is a problem and cannot be ignored.,11
74,"That was fucking embarrassing. Holy shit. Absolutely the most embarrassing loss of the season. You gain a 4-0 lead then piss your pants for 30 minutes and give it all away. Third period had zero urgency. Once the second goal was scored it all unraveled. Weak minds. No captain is definitely a large factor in that, I‚Äôm sure. Just wow..",9

81,"This has to be one of the ugliest losses in recent memory, absolutely just put their foot off the gas and never put it back.

The top line, Mack in particular looked tired, too much ice time because we don't have a second line.  If the Avs are going to go anywhere that needs to be addressed.  Otherwise this is a first round exit team.",6
82,"Can everyone stop fucking pretending that Georgiev is a good goalie? I‚Äôve never heard so much praise for mediocrity. It‚Äôs like saying Russell Wilson was good this season.

I'm not mad that we lost, shit happens. Sometimes it just doesn't go your way, it's incredibly hard to win a game in the NHL.

I'm not mad that we dropped a 4-0 lead in the second period, it is the most dangerous league in hockey after all...

&#x200B;

I'm just mad that it happened while they were wearing those alternate jerseysüò≠

But really, props to the Dogs for grinding and getting the game back under control and pulling it out. They're a good team this year and honestly healthy division competition is good, I'm glad a team in the central that's been struggling lately is starting to show some real bite.

132,"It felt like after 1 goal they still didn't wake up and start playing again, after 2 they seemed to sharpen up a bit, then wasn't the brutal wrap around goal next, and then it felt disheveled.

If people want to send Georgie packing, fine, but send Byram with him.",2
135,"I didn't think we gave up too many quality chances but we had to have spent a ton of time in our own zone. Imo we have to turtle up by spending time in their Ozone and not even try to set up anything too dangerous, just cycle cycle cycle like the canes play.",1

We joked as we watched on my phone in the hotel room that we should have changed our plans to see this game live.

Just pure suck from the team",9

150,He's got a 3.0 gaa and a .897 save percentage on the year. He's been ass. All goalies face defensive breakdowns at the end of the day the job is to stop the puck and he was barely over 80% again tonight.,4

152,"The 15 minutes is brilliant. They aren't playing awful and stealing points. They are playing like a top 5 team for 50-55 minutes, but for 10-15 they are SJS. The games change dramatically in those 10-15. I'm also sick of people saying we need a C. Stitching a C on someone's chest isn't gonna make them play a better 2nd period. We don't have a second line, we need Lehky back and we needed Tatar to step up. The fix is coming",3
153,Well your best players and only capable forwards play half the game so they‚Äôre probably tired,1
154,Loc ? He scored tonight he isn't missed,7
155,"It was always going to be a monumental task keeping the depth that made the cup team so great, but Sakic/MacFarland just haven‚Äôt had the same level of success with their depth moves in the past two years. Well, that and Landy‚Äôs health throwing a wrench into everything",6
156,I mean they allowed seven shots. That's not a bad period. One player played badly...,6

163,Fine?? What were you watching?,8
164,Never mind the rest of the team,2
165,"How many fucking times did he get the puck in the circle, skate an opening, and not take the fucking shot in the 3rd? only to pass it and we lose possession.  Jesus fuck shoot the puck every once in a while",2
166,who? jk,0
167,This,-5
168,"I agree with this, team is burnt out. Big changes gotta be made. Manson could barely move on that last play - I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs laziness. Team is lacking some reliable depth. Dont know what to do about it though",1
169,You mean his four goals on seven shots in a game they're up 4-0 isnt NHL caliber?,15
170,"It's fucking crazy to witness. Every goal against him is  mostly someone else's fault, according to this sub. I get that this team has been HORRIFIC with TOs in their own zone. But at some point, Georgiev HAS to receive some blame. He looks worse than Keumper with 1 functioning eye. He's just not good enough and we're not going to win a Cup if he continues playing like this but it extends to absolutely trash defensive play by the Avs too. This doesn't look like the same squad we used to have the last couple of years. It's so sad to watch. I miss the shot suppression and defensive prowess. I also miss having a stud in net and Georgiev is simply not a consistently good goalie this year.",12
171,"Unfortunately, with Frankie done, the Avs don't have a choice but to live or die with him. He's going to have to figure it out.",3
172,"Yep I agree with you. I've always been a big Georgie fan, but I'm not blind. He allowed four goals on seven shots. That is not good. We have a goalie problem. Also, I'm not saying this loss is fully on him. We also have a team problem. I can only hope that Sakic and Macfarland are behind the scenes working hard to address the team's biggest issues",4
173,I agree with your take. So many people content with making excuses for him all season.,2
174,Okay. Who do we get without selling everything?,1
175,"Meanwhile copers think the team is fine because of their paper tiger of a record from farming < .500 teams at home. They conveniently forget how the Avs have a 33% win rate against .500 teams and a 0% win rate on the road in the past 30 days.

That's not the trend of a first round exit, that's the trend of a team getting swept in the first round.",10
176,"Once the Coyotes got within one, I knew the Avs would lose the game.",8
177,"I love Georgie but he just doesn't seem to have the ability to steal games like he did last season. So many softies given up.

I wonder if this is just him playing bad or the team leaving him out to dry more. Probably a bit of both.",5
178,The whole team has been pretty bad at everything except scoring goals... most nights. I don't know what the fuck is happening. They're healthy for the most part.,1
179,"Just say you didn't watch the game, it would be less embarrassing.",-2
180,pregnant? sarcasm?,-6
181,The Avs have a huge problem in general. It's not just the goalie. We are stuck with Georgie the rest of the season. There isn't a goalie out there that we can get cheap,2
182,But how many shots did the Avs take in the 3rd compared to what they gave up,1
183,Preach. Go avs,6
184,Plenty of jerk off material from this season so far.,3
185,Nah that shit was not on Georgiev that was missed assignments from the defense,-5
186,Probably will go up 7-0 in the first and lose 8-7,7
187,It's a home game against a team below .500. That's the only type of game this team has a chance to win.,5

189,"Buy a new jersey, unless it's New Jersey then don't. :-)",3
190,Well it just goes to show that excellent analytics and stats don't mean a shit when a team continually makes bad plays and the goalie gives up bad goals at bad times.,1
191,Like who?,3
192,"Georgie is tied at number 1 with Demko for wins in the league. He has his misses for sure,  but this is a team issue, not just a goalie issue. 

When the Avs play strong, they win games. The issue seems to be they play for 40-50 minutes and drop after. Part of that could be relying on top line too much, but we‚Äôve got depth again so I think (as a fan, but certainly not a coach) it‚Äôs more about playing the whole game. The statement has been said before of course.",1
193,"Blowing a four-goal lead in the third period against a much weaker opponent is simply inexcusable. I'm sorry, but this team has failed to play a full sixty minutes too many times this season. Too many times they take a period off. Too many times Georgiev has let in a bad goal or two. Too many times the defense just stands around and lets the opposing team get an easy goal by leaving a man open. Too many bad trends going on with this team.",9
194,"They‚Äôre good, they get lazy when up like this",10

205,How do you rationalize giving up 5 straight goals?,10
206,wtf are you talking about it was 4-0 that was pathetic people have a right to be mad.,12
207,Not a lot you can overreact to when giving up a 4-0 lead to one of the shittiest teams in the league. This team is not a Stanley Cup contender in their current state.,8
208,"You know it, one bad loss and the sky is now falling and the seasons over! Ignoring us being first in the division and 5th in league,",2
209,Obviously.,2
210,"Nah, this season is over unless something drastic changes. Losing every game to .500 teams and every road game ain't it.",1

The Avs came back the next season and put up over 100 points and won the Central.  Was it a disappointing first round loss?  Yes.  Injuries, fatigue, and other factors certainly played in to that.

238,He had a 4 goal lead. He didn't need to steal anything.,1
239,I've got 11 upvotes that agree with my thoughts,1
240,"I mean this one is just the goalie. He has more sub 900 games than above 900 games. That's not NHL caliber.

He just allowed four goals on seven shots in a third period they were up 4-0. There's no defense of that.",3
241,Up for nothing you don't need to. You put up a period where they only get seven shots and you go home winning. Unless you're goalie is terrible.,4
242,Christ go cheer for another team then. Fair weather fans are so thin skinned,-3
243,Goal 3 and 4 were bad he can‚Äôt let those in. A wrap around goal where he is there should never go in and he was slightly screened on the 4th goal but it wasn‚Äôt tipped and just floated in. Hes gotta get one of those at least,12

Agreed. Add Lehkonen, Girard, possibly Landeskog come playoff time, and a player or two at the deadline, and they definitely are though. Edit: OH and add Kovalenko who has 83 points in his last 83 KHL games, and is already signed

Edit: oh, to add to this, imo get rid of MacDermid already. When you play him you're basically playing 11 Fs, and then an injury just limits you so much. Whats his purpose",2

278,That wraparound goal was on woods and Byram. Woods gave up and Byram had a chance to hit em but missed. Have you even played hockey?,-14

He had a .815 SV% last night. He has a .896 SV% this year. It‚Äôs not particularly good.",1

I‚Äôm not letting Georgie of the hook‚Ä¶.but it seems the game goes well and he makes the saves he needs to until the defense gives up shots that favor the shooter.",1
327,Tell me about it.,1

330,"Guess we‚Äôll find out when the season comes to a close and they move to first round.

Of the 25 years I‚Äôve been watching hockey, I‚Äôve learned to not get upset in the middle of the season. Frustration is one thing, but raging is one thing that‚Äôs pointless. They could go on a 20 game bender and crank out 30-34pts still.",3
331,Dude you got to stop making excuses for a mediocre goalie. He's not good enough,1
332,"Maybe this is who Georgie really is. Do I believe or want that? No. Come February, we will see what this team is really made of, like every year.",4
333,"Bro he makes some incredible saves!! I‚Äôm not saying all goals are on the D, I‚Äôm simply suggesting that it can 100% be the defense‚Äôs fault as well. There is something wrong on defense too, if you deny this you are just lying. You can see I‚Äôve called out the weak goals as well, he does have games where it is all on him I never said he didn‚Äôt. In terms of last night the shots favored the shooter courtesy of the defense. I don‚Äôt care if you give up 30 shots as long as they are not high %",1
334,Thats what I keep saying. Are the Avs in a decent position? For the most part yeah. I won't freak until February.,4
335,He lost us last night. Cope,1
336,"Lol seems you are the one who is needing to cope because you clearly don‚Äôt understand hockey but keep on my guy! Fans like you are the reason everyone thinks avs fans are fucking idiots, I‚Äôm starting to agree with them.",1
337,"Yep keep trying to attack me rather than the argument. Georgie save percentage is sub 900.

Somehow that's the team's fault

Lol Tell me you're dumber somehow",1
338,"At some point it has to be the user problem yes‚Ä¶you are the one telling me to ‚Äúcope‚Äù like what I‚Äôm saying is wrong. You ignore how good Georgie can be and it shows how bad the defense is because it doesn‚Äôt matter who is in net. I‚Äôm not sure there are many goalies who COULD have anything higher than 900, but again in auguring with someone who doesn‚Äôt know hockey so I‚Äôm not shocked.",1
339,"Here's the thing: of the 30 or so goalies who have faced 600 shots, Georgie has the third worst save percentage.

You're saying it's the defense which is two Norris finalists and is a sensibly the same group that won the cup.

The forward group has the presumable hart trophy finalist.

But yeah, I'm sure the defensive cup group that's been completely held together with the exception of a new goalie a year ago is at fault.

Lol

I'm not replying again. You're making me dumber",1
340,Yeah I wouldn‚Äôt reply again after bringing up past accomplishments of players we have and thinking that applies to this year when the stats DO NOT support you‚Ä¶talk about being dumber some more please! I don‚Äôt give a flying fuck if we had a full team of finalists if they are not playing well. Not much of an argument when you bring in bum accolades to ‚Äúprove‚Äù your goalie sucks.,1

They say playoffs this year, but to me that seems foolish too. Why bring him back in the most intense part of the season where people are hitting harder, playing harder, when at that point he won‚Äôt have played a game since June 2022, 22 months give or take. The amount of conditioning that will need to take place AFTER his knee is fully healed and rehabbed will take months to get into proper playing form, I just don‚Äôt see why they would even want to flirt with that potential disaster.

My reasoning:

1. Between Soup and Sammy, we now have had two super nice, wholesome goalies who stole our hearts, hit a bad stretch, and fell right off a fucking cliff. I'm pretty sure Binnington has rabies, or some sort of rage virus, so maybe he handles the pressure better.

2. 0.900 save percentage, which won't require a king's ransom, but is a massive improvement over what we have

3. Reasonably decent injury history

4. He's won a cup, so playoff experience!

5. Maybe his intensity will rub off on some of our other players?

6. He seems like the kind of guy who would scream right in Morgan Reilly's face for him to take the goddamn pass on a 2 on 1, and make him actually do it (I love you, Mo, but c'mon!)

So yeah. Who says no?",3

Only reason I can think of is that Keefe wants it to be abundantly clear that Sammy needs to be shipped out.",2
128,Lol the stat Sportsnet just put out. Samsonov SV% through 15 starts is the worst for the Leafs since 89-90. Worst in the entire NHL since 06-07.,2
129,Yer fuckin done Sammy,2
130,mrazek looking good for chi rn‚Ä¶..,2
131,Samsonov is the 2nd worst goalie in the NHL,2
132,This team blows my fucking mind,2
133,Leafs played great. We could have even won with David Ayres in net! Poor Sammy. Some AHL time might do him good. At least we got 1 point. On to tomorrow‚Äôs game! GLG!,2
134,"At this rate, Marner, Matthews and Nylander are on pace for exactly 150 goals collectively by the end of the season, assuming they play each of the remaining games at their current pace. For reference last season, they combined for 110 goals, in 2021-22 129 goals, 78 in 2021 (52 game season on pace for 117 in a full season), and in 2019-20 94 goals. This is the peak of this trio, and I'm not sure how much else you can expect from them. The expected GA tonight was about 2, we need a goalie upgrade; as cliche, as that is, Martin Jones and an injured Rookie, Woll, will not be filling the net adequately for 49 more games when the starter coming into this season, Samsonov is UNPLAYABLE IN THE NHL. That's right, for all intents and purposes, at this moment, goalie depth is Woll (IR), Jones, Hildeby (AHL), Petruzelli (AHL), then Samsonov (AHL). This is the reality at the moment, and it's not good enough. A trade must be made for a goalie that is either better or equal to that of Martin Jones, or else we will fade fast, regardless of goal-scoring.",2
135,"I hate to beat on a dead horse but there's no way any NHL team can win with the goaltending Sammy has provided this year. He looked bad in preseason and it carried over to the regular season to the point where he's unplayable now.

Yes defensively there's holes in the Leafs game but you need saves.",2
136,"Obviously Sammy needs to get lost, but they have made unreal defensive mistakes. 

Two from this game

1. that super bad line change
2. I don't recall which goal but Columbus had one guy with the puck at the end boards and 3 Leafs chased him back there. Easy feed to an unguarded slot. Stupid shit from Domi who saw two defenders below the goal line on the puck carrier and decided they needed a third with no shoulder check at all.

There are a couple terrible defensive mistakes or giveaways every night and Sammy is adrift. The latter will resolve itself soon but they'll still desperately need to figure out the former.",2
137,"This is not gonna be a popular take, and I know the line looks bad, but it's really only the Fantilli goal and OT goal (maybe) that are really on him. The rest are defensive errors and bad bounces.",2

Thanks for Tampa last year buddy good luck.",2
141,"Sammy was horrible as always, guys lost it, but let‚Äôs not forget about Keefe keeping him in. Should have pulled him after 3 goals. The only thing keeping faith in Keefe is he was hoping Sammy would blow it so he would never play him again",3

Only 11 shots after two period. Fantastic job.

20 shot total with OT. Can't complain about that.",4

145,"It's not just the fact that Samsonov is playing horribly, Keefe should not be giving him these many chances. He needs to go down to the AHL because Samsonov in the NHL is benefiting no one but the other team.",2

153,"Okay we‚Äôre all in agreement that Sammy should be waived and sent to the minors. But the defence doesn‚Äôt look good either. While Sammy should have had maybe 3 or 4 of the goals. We blew d zone coverage, we lost puck battles too often, we got pinned a few times, and just had bad d overall. 66% of our team really isn‚Äôt good enough for a playoff run in its current state, we‚Äôre just out scoring our problems which won‚Äôt work in the playoffs. When do we start questioning our defensive coordinator?",1

213,Yup I was with you too. But honestly he just doesn‚Äôt have it. And I was willing to be a little patient if he had a decent enough bounce back game. And I even said to my son that even after the 4 goals on 11 shots that if he played sharp the rest of the game then it‚Äôs something to build on but that 5th goal can‚Äôt happen. It was very reminiscent of the first one he let in the other night. If the first 4 goals had his fate made up by management then the 5th goal was the dagger.

Another goalie in Net and rielly let's the point keep the puck and takes away the pass. Starting from the 2nd intermission on they weren't going to let them take any shots at all, they had like 2 until the goal, CBJ picked up on that and in OT with more space to find plays it was inevitable, see what happened with fantillis chance just before.

The craziest part? He was the first Leafs goalie in 18 years to deliver a series winning performance. Freddy and Soup soiled themselves for 6 years in a row before Sammy gave us the masterpiece that was game6 down in Tampa. 

Life as a Toronto fan, the joyous moments are short and there‚Äôs usually a bomb dropped on you not long after lol",2
362,"Man he‚Äôs trying so hard to keep himself positive, it‚Äôs hard to watch. 

I thought the exact same thing, his face is extremely skinny. He was never a huge guy but he had some meat to him, didn‚Äôt look like that in the presser. 

I hope he‚Äôs doing alright hockey aside, he‚Äôs a great guy.",4
363,Uh but didn't Brad re-sign him? Instead of....not signinging him?,3
364,Brad Treliving signed Sammy this off-season,6
365,Russia lol,5
366,"KHL, back to russia",2
367,It's a lot like watching a car crash. I'd tune in,3
368,i dont get why he consistently takes the wrong player in odd man situations just box the guy at the net,6
369,Last year he was fine yeah. Now he's absolutely terrible.,3
370,"I really wonder what's going on. There's got to be something more. Treliving or Keefe wanting to keep him up, maybe there's more to his personal issues that he hasn't made public, I dunno. All of that is made up but I wonder.",2
371,He should have taken Gaudreau there but he was probably thinking fuck I better take away the point shot here because any shot is going in,8
372,"Morgan had two guys to cover either try and help with the shot or takeaway the pass. With Sammy in net neither is a good option.

Nylander was the one skating for a breakout without the puck",7
373,Think that one's on willy,1
374,Probably been to OT the most,1
375,Mental suffering or a lack thereof is worth a lot to some people.,2
376,Yea and that would be way more worth a shot than letting this dude that‚Äôs clearly got the yips or knows he‚Äôs done play and lose games,1
377,"Hopefully he makes the right decision and trades him for a Powerade cooler, guys useless",1
378,There's no doubt he's telling them to find him a goalie,1
379,Hutch was put on waivers on Thursday.,3
380,And I'm just pointing out they're a bunch of pussies,-4
381,"Yeah,  because I genuinely think Marner should be playing for another team.",-4
382,The coach too!,1
383,Comment was a Knee Jerk reaction. Any word when Woll is back?,2
384,What a shame. He looked good last year,3
385,Very creative haha,1
386,Under the bus? He‚Äôs not doing his job he gets paid millions to do,-1
387,The truth,0
388,look who got offended by a reddit post lmao,-6
389,[deleted],-8
390,Its a joke,8
391,Sorry save percentage,18
392,Sv%. Only Raanta was worse and he was sent packing.,14
393,I would assume everything,9
394,"14 gp 
0.871 sv%",1
395,Kallgren is in the Devils org this year,17
396,Kallgren is not in the organization anymore lol,10
397,he isn‚Äôt in the organization anymore.,6
398,I feel so bad for him üò© imagine what goes on through his head ü•≤,7
399,"Agreed, it seemed like he was hyperventilating. Made me anxious to watch that.",1
400,".860 is worse than the 80s


Andrew Raycroft, one of the worse goalies in leafs history, worst season was .876


.860 truly amazing. Jack Campbell became unplayable this year at .880.


Samsonov probably isnt even AHL caliber. ECHL maybe",6
401," okay I get the sentiment (I even share it at this point)

however an argument can be made against it, 

hear me out, lets do the math

* lets say we get Joseph Woll back in full form on Feb 19th (Game against the Blues)
* there are 20 games between now and then if i'm counting right
* Lets say they Give Jones 12 Games and Sammy 8 (to avoid overplaying Jones)
* now lets say Jones wins 8/12 (16 points)
* and Sammy loses all of his but manages to get 4 to OT (4 points)
* that's 20 points in 20 Games

which  would mean they'd have 61 points in 53 Games which would put them on  track for 94 Points in the season (maybe Woll gets that number up to  100)

That's still enough for the Leafs to get to the Playoffs with a Healthy Jones and Woll

I  get the frustration with Sammy (I even share it) but I think  Overplaying Jones or risking Hildeby is a big mistake, for now their  best move is to just hang on with what they have until Woll comes back",-3
402,This is exactly what a bunch of caps fans warned us about.,8
403,its not unexpected at all. Last year was unexpected. He is closer to what he is now than he is to what he was last year,3
404,I think they knew he was a headcase. Very emotional which is hard to change.,3
405,We thought it was a steal.  Lol.  Young goalie with all this potential!,2
406,"I am starting to question Treleving's decisions. He REALLY missed by acquiring Reeves, Domi just doesn't have it, Bertuzzi is washed up, continuing to play Robertson is a mistake and Knies really doesn't have the skill to be on that top line.",-5
407,the shooter was far out he should of stayed on Gaudreau but as usual Reilly takes the wrong man on an odd man attack,1
408,I can't think of many point per game 2 million dollar players man,4
409,Why would that be Tavares man. Jt was still tangled up with the center?,1
410,JT also lost the draw clean so I‚Äôm gonna count him in the group lol,3
411,Realistically never should of gotten to overtime anyway. The roller coaster of being a Leaf fan! They will probably beat Carolina and LA back to back now before losing 3 straight to Anaheim and San Jose knowing this team haha,3
412,"It looks like it was a miscommunication on the play between Willy and JT. No idea who, as I wasn‚Äôt privy to the play they had drawn up, so for now I‚Äôll have to put it equally on the pair of them.",1
413,Samsonov is at .862 after tonight's game. I don't know where this .840 is coming from.,2
414,It's already been written. That loss happened 3 days ago.,10
415,Micheal Hutchinson available... LoL,5
416,"Petruzzeli is a realistic option if you don't want to disturb Hildeby. Have Jones as a clear cut nr1 and Petruzzeli as a emergency back up.  If you bring up Hildeby you gotta play him. Which means you kinda ""waste"" Jones.",4
417,"Assuming they want hildeby to play w the big boys I agree, but I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs wise to have hildeby play a tandem role for 6 weeks in the nhl

But I think you‚Äôre right, other than hildeby there‚Äôs no other option",1
418,Waive Sammy bring up hildeby and let it ride,1
419,Do you not see the /s ?,1
420,"100%, hope he gets whatever he needs.",2
421,the deal itself is actually good if he played close to last year it would be a steal but he's trash and management insists on playing him for no reason that is what is screwing us,11
422,"at least it was arbitration and only one year, we wouldve had a campbell 5x5 2.0",7
423,"They went to arbitration. And the fan base woulda lynched Treliving if he hadn‚Äôt brought Sammy back. He was solid last year.

Woll is the future. Maybe Jones in the backup role, until the Hildebeast matures.",5
424,"He had no choice. We paid as little as possible, gave no term, and had no other options besides Woll.

Tre saved us from a Jarry disasterclass",3
425,We couldn't have known it was going to be this bad,1
426,Maybe that's weighing on him. Not saying they should play him but it is likely a legitimate concern of his,2
427,"I wouldn‚Äôt say he was our worst goalie tho, Petr definitely holds that in my books",1
428,This is exactly what happened.  The team has no faith in Samsonov making the save which makes them play differently,5
429,üòÇ ya that‚Äôs fair in this case I guess.,1
430,This is possibly the biggest pay cheque of his life.  He just has to go to practice for a few more months and he gets his full contract.,1
431,You think he‚Äôs gonna throw his teammate under the bus like that? We all know the same canned responses are coming out‚Ä¶,6
432,Look who doesn't know the rules of this subreddit. The topic is about the postgame against the CBJ. Not about your whiny pissy fits over politics. You want to talk about politics go to another reddit page.,3
433,~~Least Sportsmanlike~~ the only Columbus Fan,1
434,That's terrible news. :(,2
435,Fuck really? I liked him,3
436,I would have to think Hildeby has played his whole life hoping for a shot in the show. I don't really see why people are saying don't give him a shot to protect him like are we just never gonna let him have a game?,3
437,"Accepting 4 of a potential 16 points is a no go. And I am not sure 94 points gets us into the playoffs this year.

He cannot play again.",1
438,lol stop drinking,2
439,You have never played hockey eh,0
440,It's the number quoted at the top of this subreddit right now.  But that must be incorrect.,3
441,Unreal. Make the call Mr tree,1
442,PTSD haha,1
443,I'd love it hahah,1
444,I need to get more hammered in order to let it sink in this might be worth considering....,1
445,He has a 0.879 in the AHL right now - keith doesn‚Äôt make much sense. You‚Äôre choice is realistically to change course on not giving Hildeby NHL reps or not.,6
446,Petruzzeli was always going to be the next guy up. Not Hildeby. Let the man cook in the A. He's still so young.,5
447,I don‚Äôt disagree. I don‚Äôt really know. I agreed with not letting Hildeby touch the NHL this year and come along slowly / get confidence but Samsonov has been so bad you might have to change course,3
448,They play him because they can't play Jones two nights in a row.,1
449,Yup. Double edge sword (about Treliving sign/not Sign sammy),1
450,Exactly. Shit happens,1
451,"Yeah, like, for all we know there's something massive weighing on him. But, callous as this may sound, nobody cares. If you can't hack it, you need to go, and Sammy can't hack it.",2
452,Yeah I'm being hyperbolic. He's just so fucking bad! Wouldn't want Petr either haha,1
453,I honestly believe he can slowly recovery mentally somewhere else. But the longer this goes for him the less likely he is to ever recover. But I agree it's unlikely they think beyond this years money.,1
454,Why the hell are they putting him in front of the media????,2
455,Throwing him under the bus? He‚Äôs not doing his job. He just has to say he‚Äôs not playing well. Can‚Äôt even do that because everyone‚Äôs sensitive,-1
456,"you are the one who first mentioned ""politics"" and started wasting time.

do not respond to this thread again, no one wants to hear it",-2
457,"is true that Hildeby has waited his whole life for a chance in the show

that's the concern

remember when u got your first ""real"" job as an adult how nervous u were because u didn't want to blow it, how u felt that ANY mistake u made would get u sent back to the unemployment line 

Hildeby is only 22, he's worked incredibly hard to get where he is and the expectations are skyhigh (especially in Toronto where even experienced Veterans hesitate to go due to the intense pressure)

plus while he's doing well in the AHL the NHL is much tougher competition so he likely wont be the superstar he is right now

every mistake would not only be amplified but it would feel like his dream is being chipped away at 

better to wait until he gets atleast another season or 2 done in the AHL before calling him up",1
458,Beers help the Hutchinson algorithm,1
459,"Again I'm not advocating to start Keith. I'm saying have him as the backup, and put him in for a game or 2 if Jones needs the rest. 

You can even start Hildeby in those games one or two games if you want. But bringing Hildeby up to either be on the bench or take the starts from Jones is a mistake IMO.",3
460,"Even if Petru is as bad, Sammy needs work somewhere else",1
461,"I totally agree. I'm not sure 1 or 2 games in the show(as an emergency) could hurt him so much as to put his development out of line, but as a permanent solution, yeah they really shouldn't put him in that spotlight and potentially hurt his confidence.",1
462,Like he was a star last year looked poised for a huge breakout took honestly what would have been a smoking good deal if he played to last year's standards with Woll playing tandem. It took like three bad games at the start of the year and he shattered its a shame cause he doesn't even look like the same goalie in net. No poise swimming in the net and for some reason his athleticism seems to have taken a beating,1
463,I would take him over Sammy rn,2
464,You‚Äôre dreaming pal.,3
465,"No my dad would just yell at me then we carried on working until he stopped yelling at me for stupid shit?

No I get it but what other options do we have?",1
466,Both seem to come from the same swimming/goalie school dont they,1
467,Make him the team swim coach,1
