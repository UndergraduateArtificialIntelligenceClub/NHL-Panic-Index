'Lol. It''s almost the whole atlantic division there.',173
yeah. so many teams in top10 with ~+10 and we are lonely with -1. It looks so off,64
Weâ€™re the best team in the universe,186
'The Bruins lose Bergeron and I''m like that''s it, they will fall a bit, but no...',60
'While i''m still team rebuild, this is friggin great.',74
December is coming. We always start hot and fade.,29
'5 teams from our Division in the top 9 lol...

I honestly think that if we''re were actually healthy and in the west we''d be a playoff team',55
Is if just me or is Monahan the glue for the current edition of the habs. We were doing great last year until the Monahan injury.,14
'We have a good team, we are just stuck playing against the best teams in the league. Our division is the strongest. I am sure we would do far more better in any other division.',13
"Please ignore the RW column!",7
'Right you are, Ken!',8
While it wonâ€™t last( I would hope to be wrong) it is still enjoyable. We canâ€™t rely on our goalie that much though. Young team so no worries . Go Habs,6
Iâ€™m just sad the think that Dach wouldâ€™ve profited from all of this so much. Good atmosphere surrounding the group rn,6
'The Atlantic division is returning to tradition with BOS, TOR, MTL and DET at the top',5
'Love to see it but tbh we''ve faced a lot of weak teams. Still, the guys never give up and we are coming along nicely. Love the future of this team.',7
Encouraging but a couple of our wins were due to stellar goaltending and not games we really deserved to win. This trip were about to take out west will tell a lot.,3
Montreal Canadiens are temporarily the 5th best team in the league.,6
Yes they are,2
Ima ride as long as it lasts lol,2
'What in the-... is this for real??? Stanley Cup, here we come.',2
'Just to be clear this isnâ€™t the rebuild going well or anything.

We are being bailed out by elite goaltending every game.

This isnâ€™t sustainable',2

'Weird that New Jersey isn''t on this list, they seem like juggernauts',2
'Wait, 15 more games....',2
How funny would it be if they stopped the regular season today and we ended up playing Toronto again in the first round?,3
Ã€ LA COUPE!,4
'Don''t wanna burst anyone''s bubble but habs are getting insane goaltending right now

Allen''s rocking a .930 and near 10 GSAx in 4 games which is insane 

Unless it was literally prime Carey Price you shouldn''t expect those numbers to last and even then it''s insane',1
'Actually, tied for 4th. Same record as the Laffs but, of course, the Toronto loving media will always present the Laffs above them graphically.',0
'We''ve lost both Savard and Dach but I''m one of those diehards hopeful that if we clean up our passing game a little and run better with less ref interference that we could actually make the playoffs this year. Hope this excitement continues',0
Sssssssh. Donâ€™t jinx it.,1
As expected,1
Fifth in the league yet only third in our division.  Crazy.,1
Which would be great if the season was 8 games long. Really?,1
Wild that we have a -1 diff too,1
'<insert Michael Scott "IT''S HAPPENING, STAY CALM" gif here>',1
'With this start, I could see them being something like 12-9-1 by December. November gets harder, but there are still some very winnable games. Hopefully, the injury bug doesn''t get more out of hand. If they could stay a little more disciplined, their defensive numbers would improve significantly. It looks like Suzuki is putting more of an emphasis on defensive play this season.',1
As they should be.,1
This is not the time to be soft,1
'This is so fantastic to see. 

I am still in awe of the game Guhle played last night. In overtime he was skating so fast, with so much confidence, every other player on the ice looked like they were standing still. 

And he''s 21 years old.',1
'https://theathletic.com/5004272/2023/10/27/nhl-power-rankings-taylor-swift-vegas-golden-knights/

But these three Ontario writers have them ranked 28th. Whatâ€™s actually true?

Lolz',1
'Yaaaaaaa, I''d give it another month. The teams ok, but we are def a bottom 10 team. go habs go',1
Ca sent la coupeðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,1
Iâ€™m not going to lie I like the success but I really want us to finish low in the standings to get a top 5 pick again.,1
Itâ€™s early in the season but I am liking the progress of the young players.,1
Soon enough boys soon enough,1
