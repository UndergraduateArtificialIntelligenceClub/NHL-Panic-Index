Leading 2-0 after 40 minutes, the play looked a lot more Hurricanes-like. Pyotr Kochetkov was solid through two periods as well. Then, a third period collapse. Calgary scored three goals in 6:02, storming from behind to take the win. Post-game, Rod Brind'Amour and players alike were critical of the team \"sitting back and watching\" during the final period of regulation.\n\n\nNet-Front Traffic\n\nBoth of Carolina's first period goals on Thursday came on redirections.  Stefan Noesen tipped home a Jaccob Slavin shot to start the night, and then Michael Bunting changed the path of a Dmitry Orlov blast to put the team up two.  Look for the Canes to try and utilize more of that this evening.  They've had no problems getting pucks to the net this season, leading the league with their average of 34.6 per night, however, their average of 3.23 goals per game ranks tied for 15th.\n\n\n1,200 For The Captain\n\nForward Jordan Staal is set to play in his 1,200th NHL game this evening.  Acquired by the Canes on June 22, 2012, 768 of his games have come with the franchise after 431 with Pittsburgh to start his career.\nSelected second overall by the Penguins in the 2006 NHL Draft, he is set to join Phil Kessel (BOS/TOR/PIT/ARI/VGK: 1,286 GP) as the second player from his draft class to reach the milestone. Staal also looks to become the 10th active player to log 1,200 career NHL games, joining Brent Burns (1,359 GP) as the second Hurricanes skater on that list. \n\n\nIn Net\n\nWith Kochetkov having played on Thursday, if the team's rotation stays intact, Antti Raanta could be in line for the start this evening. Raanta played 54+ minutes in relief on Wednesday in Edmonton after Kochetkov was pulled early, stopping 25/28. On the season, Raanta is 6-4 and he has a .917 save percentage in three career appearances against the Canucks.\n\n\nOn The Other Side\n\nAfter starting the season 12-3-1, the Canucks have come back down to earth a bit, but are still playing strong hockey. J.T. Miller leads the Western Conference with 39 points in 27 games and Quinn Hughes leads all NHL defensemen with 36 points in the same amount of contests. Of all goalies that have played 15 games this season, Thatcher Demko's .917 save percentage ranks third. Where hasn't Vancouver excelled this season? If there's one area to point out, perhaps it's their penalty kill, which ranks 27th, killing off just 74.7% of attempts this season.\n\n\nInjury Updates\n\nGoaltender Frederik Andersen is sidelined indefinitely after the team announced on November 6 that he is dealing with a blood clotting issue.\n\nForward Andrei Svechnikov was a last-minute scratch on Thursday in Calgary and ruled out due to an upper-body injury.  No update was available post-game and the Canes did not practice Friday, so no new information has been offered.\n\n\nWhat Are We Wearing?\n\nThe team will be wearing their white sweaters tonight", "score": 7, "date": "2023-12-09", "subreddit": "canes"}, {"submission_id": "18eq6w6", "comment_id": "kcpcjoy", "body": "**Forwards**\n\nTeravainen - Aho - Necas  \nBunting - Kotkaniemi - Jarvis  \nMartinook - Staal - Fast  \nLemieux - Drury - Noesen\n\n**Defense**\n\nSlavin - Burns  \nSkjei - Pesce  \nOrlov - Chatfield\n\n**Goaltenders**\n\nRaanta  \nKochetkov\n\n**Injuries**\n\nFrederik Andersen (Blood Clotting Issue)  \nAndrei Svechnikov (Upper-Body Injury)\n\n**Healthy Scratches**\n\nTony DeAngelo\n\n**PP1:** Aho, Drury, Jarvis, and Teravainen with Burns\n\n**PP2:** Bunting, Kotkaniemi, Necas, and Noesen with Slavin", "score": 6, "date": "2023-12-09", "subreddit": "canes"}, {"submission_id": "18eq6w6", "comment_id": "kcpnldm", "body": "My sources have informed me that we will win 4-2\nIt came to me in a dream", "score": 7, "date": "2023-12-09", "subreddit": "canes"}, {"submission_id": "18eq6w6", "comment_id": "kcpza63", "body": "Ready to get steamrolled by the Canucks...but hoping for a different outcome", "score": 6, "date": "2023-12-09", "subreddit": "canes"}, {"submission_id": "18eq6w6", "comment_id": "kcpzi6i", "body": "i am TIRED i am SICK i have FINALS but y'all already know i'm here to subject y'all to my thoughts", "score": 6, "date": "2023-12-09", "subreddit": "canes"}, {"submission_id": "18eq6w6", "comment_id": "kcq1ie2", "body": "Did Rod shower three mins ago lol", "score": 5, "date": "2023-12-09", "subreddit": "canes"}, {"submission_id": "18eq6w6", "comment_id": "kcq1s1q", "body": "Holy shit", "score": 6, "date": "2023-12-09", "subreddit": "canes"}, {"submission_id": "18eq6w6", "comment_id": "kcq1v3b", "body": "WHAT A SAVE ANTII", "score": 5, "date": "2023-12-09", "subreddit": "canes"}, {"submission_id": "18eq6w6", "comment_id": "kcq25ca", "body": "Father Finn giveth and Father Finn taketh", "score": 6, "date": "2023-12-09", "subreddit": "canes"}, {"submission_id": "18eq6w6", "comment_id": "kcq2aht", "body": "Each post game our coach and captain say the team hasn\u2019t bought yet.

Leafs don't need depth D, we have it for days. We need to upgrade on Brodie and McCabe. Those are the minutes we're losing. Get Tanev for Mo, get Hanifin/Sanheim for Liljegren. I don't hate McCabe in a 3rd line role. \n\n- Marner has a 46.6% xG%. Nobody misses Bunting more than him. Bertuzzi doesn't have the IQ to play with him. They play games that don't compliment eachother. \n\nLines I'd like to see. They're slightly off the board, but you'll learn a lot about players/chemistry and can see what does and doesn't work.

He hasn't found a RW he has chemistry with yet. Might as well try the Swiss Army knife that Matthews likes to play with. That line will be dominant off the cycle. \n\n- Bert, JT, Nylander need no explanation. They were dominant. \n\n- 3rd line is the most interesting. London connection. Undersized, but all have high hockey IQ, and motors. Domi and Marner play a different game than everyone else on the team. Both are elite playmakers. Neither has had the opportunity to play with another elite playmaker. They both understand how to get open, and can make split second decisions to move the play forward. If they can hit eachother in spots that they hit other players then that line could could be a threat to score every shift. Robertson is smart enough to get the puck to the other 2, and get open. Something Bertuzzi and Knies have struggled to do with Marner.\n\n- Team needs a new OT philosophy. The team should focus on the cycle in OT. Eat 30-45 seconds in the offensive zone, and then make changes while holding possession. Next line up is going against a tired group. Much better idea than trading chances.

I think Robertson is one who would do this as well if given top 6 ice time, and is a player we should keep.\n\nHe is finally healthy to start a season, has vastly improved his speed (which in turn makes him more evasive), but he also has gotten stronger on the puck and isn't going head first into corners anymore - I hope he finally gets a full season under his belt. More importantly, the guy is a beast for pace and effort out there. He is routinely the hardest skating guy and always gives 110%. Not to mention he has an insane release, Matthews said he has the hardest shot on the team for context, and his playmaking and chemistry with Domi has been impressive.\n\nHe makes rookie mistakes, as most young players do, but I've been very impressed with Nicky Bobby and can see him being a big part of this team.

Both realize Nelson got loose, and skate out, and you end up with Nelson getting a clean shot and no one in front to potentially get the rebound or tie up Engvall.  \n\nSecond goal is clearly Marner messing up.\n\nThird goal is a bit out of my knowledge.  I think the first mistake is on Knies.  He's effectively the center, and he should be helping box out players net front.  3 Leafs stop on the rail while Engvall slowly drifts past.  This forces Matthews to cover that pass - if not, he could have gotten the puck from Nelson.  The large mistake is that Timmins is slow to react to Laggeson being beat - he should the one to pick him up.  That gives Nelson the time he needs to make that pass. Bit of a weak goal to let in by Sammy as well.\n\nSo I'd say 1 against Bertuzzi, 1 against Marner, 0.5 against Knies, and 0.5 against Timmins.

Going through struggles throughout the season, battling it out and grinding through hurdles, prepares the team for the real test later on. Look at Florida last year, injuries and struggles all season and barely squeaked into the Playoffs with 1 point difference in their last game; but that struggle galvanized the team to come together and work as a unit and that catapulted them to a SCF appearance.
